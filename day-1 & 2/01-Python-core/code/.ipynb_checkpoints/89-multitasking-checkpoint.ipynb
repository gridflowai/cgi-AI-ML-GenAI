    "### multitasking \n",
    "\n",
    "- refers to the ability of a program to execute multiple tasks simultaneously or concurrently. \n",
    "- This allows a program to make efficient use of system resources and improve overall performance by executing tasks concurrently instead of sequentially.\n",
    "-----------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 primary approaches to achieve multitasking in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Multithreading`: \n",
    "    - Multithreading is a way of achieving multitasking by dividing a program into multiple threads. Each thread represents an independent flow of execution within the same process. \n",
    "    - Threads can run concurrently, sharing the same resources like memory space, file descriptors, etc. Python provides a built-in threading module that allows you to create and manage threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Multiprocessing`: \n",
    "    - Multiprocessing is another way of achieving multitasking by dividing a program into multiple processes. \n",
    "    - Each process runs independently and has its memory space, allowing true parallelism. \n",
    "    - Python provides a built-in multiprocessing module that allows you to create and manage processes."
